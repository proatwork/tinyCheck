# Outdated/Unmaintained

This is no longer a solution for styling checkboxes/radio inputs.
Just use `appearance: none` and style the inputs as you wish with good old CSS :)

# tinyCheck
Custom Checkboxes JS Plugin
#### Usage
```javascript
        jQuery('input[type=radio], input[type=checkbox]').tinyCheck();
```
#### CSS : You are on your own... for now.
